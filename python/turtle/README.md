# Python Turtle Demonstrations
A collection of demonstrations using Python's [Turtle graphics library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html).

## What is a Turtle?
[Turtle graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics) is a simple method of drawing lines, shapes, images, 
and more to a user's screen. It was first popularized by the [Logo educational programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_\(programming_language\)) in 1967! Common instructions to a turtle are "turn left," "turn right," "go forward," "stop drawing," "start drawing," and more!

## Demonstration Requirements

- [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)[^1]

[^1]: Optional. Not all demonstrations utilize the `matplotlib` library.

## Running

It is recommended you run these programs through a [command-line interface](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_cli.asp).
Alternatively, you can run the demonstrations through [IDLE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html), which is typically
included with your Python installation.
